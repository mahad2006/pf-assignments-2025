This repository contains my Programming Fundamentals assignments, practice problems, and solutions.

## 🔹 How to Use This Repo?

- Each **week's folder** contains problems assigned in that week's class.
- Each **`.cpp` file** is a solution to a specific problem.
- Each **week has a `README.md`** that describes the problems in detail.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
✔️ Variables & Data Types  
✔️ Conditional Statements  
✔️ Loops & Iterations  
✔️ Functions  
✔️ Arrays & Pointers *(Upcoming)*
